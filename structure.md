## Agile README Template

### 1. Project Overview

Ta3allam aims to digitize and streamline student learning experiences for Arabic-speaking users, particularly in Syria and surrounding regions.
This frontend application replicates the core UI/UX of Brightspace, with localization support and mobile-friendly viewing.

The primary goals:

* Easy student access to courses and materials
* Centralized dashboard for communication and schedules
* Full Arabic support across UI

### 2. Technology Stack

* **Framework**: Next.js (React)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
* **Auth**: Auth0 (email-based only for MVP)
* **Routing**: Next.js App Router
* **State Management**: Zustand / React Context
* **Localization**: i18n with full Arabic RTL support

### 3. Application Structure

```
/app              ‚Üí Next.js App Router pages & layouts
/components       ‚Üí Reusable UI components
/lib              ‚Üí Utilities, API handlers
/store            ‚Üí Zustand or Context stores
/styles           ‚Üí Global Tailwind styles
/locales          ‚Üí Arabic & English translation files
/public           ‚Üí Static assets
```

### 4. Frontend Architecture

* **Login flow**: Auth0 (Email only)

* **Dashboard**: Course cards, timetable, messages/notifications

* **Course View**: Sticky sub-navbar with tabs:

  * Course Home (Announcements)
  * Content (Lessons & PDFs)
  * Course Tools (Assignments, Groups, Discussions)
  * Classlist
  * Help

* **Mobile Support**: View-only access on phones/tablets. Uploads and assignments restricted to desktop, like Brightspace.

* **RTL support**: Arabic is the primary course language. All components must render correctly in RTL.

### 5. Development Workflow

* Agile sprints (2-week)
* Feature branches via Git (`feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`)
